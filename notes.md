# spinning plates at the circus of awe

a dance of stillness and motion
the stillness that enables the movement
the movement that enables the stillness

the plates rotate
you rotate

right under the surface
theres an abundance of you
behind the masks that you wear

the show ends
once everything falls away
and the thing that remains
is stillness and love

you are not the conductor
you are not the orchestra
you are the silence
you are the void


there's something funny about buses
