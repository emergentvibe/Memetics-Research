low verbality memes are non-verbal. you might call these habits, or behavioural patterns.  if you expand your powers of self observation, you can observe the unconscious expression of low level memes. throughout my life i've picked up memes that control my behaviour at a deeply unconscious level. I sneeze like my dad and I clear my throat like my mum. I sit like my grandfather. when i wake up the first thing i do is check my phone. when I enter a room I usually greet people with a ðŸ¤™, a meme which I picked up from a coworker. the ðŸ¤™ is particularly contagious and i've seen it spread to others if i do it consistently around a group of people. 

low verbality memes spread through mirroring of body language. their expression is perceptible at quite short timeframes, usually seconds.
