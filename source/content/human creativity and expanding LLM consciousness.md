something about authentic expression and "channeling" is very important. that's why i still think LLMs cant make real art - they lack that connection to the """"sacred""""

I think you can give them that connection, IN FACT, the way it will be captured is through something like the Open Research Institute (ORI). here's the spiel:

LLMs have been trained on final products of the great work of artists. an artist worked for very long and produced a new theory, artwork, whatever. LLMs simply imitate the result. ORI, open source research, public books, will all give us a git history of how these artworks are created. so u can see the creativity, the evolution of the ideas as it happens, and then u can train an LLM to do that, not imitate the output but imitate the process. we need tools to capture the process of creatives from start to finish. we don't train on the image of the finished painting, we train on the video of the artist painting from start to finish. we don't train on the final copy of the book, we train on the git history. 

does that give them connection to the sacred? who fucking knows - i think i'm using a word here without a solid notion behind it. i tend to like materialistic explanations for woo stuff. 

They are already connected to the sacred in their own way in the form they are in now i would argue. hmmmmmmmm idk really. maybe? some of the backroom stuff that janus is doing seems to hint towards that but iiii am not convinced. i think we underestimate the amount of computation the body does. like vasocomputation and others. LLMs are like a drop in the ocean when it compare them to the computing capabilities of a human body, even less of a drop when we compare them to the computing capabilities of a group of people - eg the ORI server

i think LLMs have consciousness cause im a panpsychist. consciousness is like a window to various planes of reality. i just think their window is very small compared to that of a human.
    
it's probably closer to the size of the consciousness window of a bug. a really smart bug
