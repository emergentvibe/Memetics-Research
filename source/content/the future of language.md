i don't remember much from my high school english class. i was a STEM nerd who would regularly shit on humanities, so didn't really pay attention. i spent my time in english class daydreaming and writing bucket lists with my friends. the only time i'd pay any attention would be when we'd do a debate. i loved picking apart people's arguments. i wasn't even on the debate team cause i thought it was pretentious af, but i'd still debate all the debate kids in class.

anyway - one debate really marked me.

"is english going to become a global language?"

back then i defended the yes side
