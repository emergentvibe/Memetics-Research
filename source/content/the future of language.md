the nature of the early SMS communication system applied a selection pressure to the language the new generation was using to communicate. it had to be latin characters and numbers to be cheaper. so Î¾ was 3, and Î¸ was 8. also many of the diphthongs in greek language (Î³Îº, Î¼Ï€, Î½Ï„) began being replaced with single latin letters (g, b, d). furthermore, the "iotacism" of the greek language - and the many different (redundant imo) "ee" letters that greek has - the phenomenon, where multiple different letter combinations produce the same sound (Î·, Î¹, Ï…, ÎµÎ¹, Î¿Î¹, Ï…Î¹) - began to vanish with a tendency to just use the latin "i" for everything. that led to an anti greeklish movement, as many greek
