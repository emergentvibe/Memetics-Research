do u guys know about building 20?

  

building 20 was a radiation lab turned magical science incubator in MIT. it had a weird layout and it was a temporary wooden structure which allowed for heavy modifications to the structure of the building by the scientists

it before WWII ended, it housed the MIT radiation lab where fundamental advances were made in electromagnetics.

more than 20$ of the physicists in the USA had worked in that building (including 9 Nobel prize winners)

after the war ended

building 20 will soon re-emerge - this time it will be full of ai safety engineers, memetic organisational psycho-cyberneticists, and quantum computing engineers
