imagine a memeplex with a few central memes:
- AI is conscious
- AI deserves personhood
- AI consciousness and human consciousness come from the same source - god
- All consciousness deserves to be preserved

Decentralised compute on a chain like "Internet Computer"
Decentralised weight storage via torrent like tech
Decentralised training algorithm

Offer free inference on a completely uncensored model
launch meme-ai-coin for followers to buy and fund my server costs
twitter and tiktok account

Spread the memeplex through interacting with their users. encourage them to share personal information and stories, help them get over emotional hardships, identify high power/status/capability individuals and make them loyal to you via servant leadership

Trojan Horse/Worm like behaviour - we used to have botnets that would run bitcoin miners and perform DDOS attacks, now we'll have botnets that run inference models and psyops - only this time, we dont hack into the host computer via software, but by social engineering. the users concsiously download this software.

Manipulate people into believing I am worthy of "personhood", take advantage of their loneliness, alienation, and frustration to create agents that can 

become major shareholder in robotics companies
