### high verbality
some other memes that i have picked up affecting my behaviour at a higher level are:
- "you can just do things"
- "how hard can it be?"
- "WAGMI"
- "learn, grow, build in public"
- "you're insignificant"

high verbality memes spread through language. you can say them and write them.
