ehh the following is meh meh but i'll leave it here

Behaviours are [[emergence|emergent]] and [[evolution|evolving]]. A behaviour is an adaptive sequence of moves. A behaviour like a bird building a nest is composed by a bundle of [[fixed action patterns|fixed action patterns]] all put together. The pattern to pick up sticks. The pattern to stack them next to each other. The pattern to do that high up in a tree where there are no predators. The pattern to give birth where you are safe.

The expression of these instinctual patterns is exclusively determined by the bird's genes. The behaviour is sort of like a collection of reflexes. A bird that has never seen another bird build a nest will build some kind of nest. Their genome has instructions to build certain neural pathways that encode those action patterns during fetal development. 

Here we see an example of a geno-memetic interaction. Genes giving rise to [[memes - coding and regulating behaviour|Memes]].

During the lifetime of a bird, it will hone-in (or forget) their nest-building skills. Not only that, if that bird lives in a community, it will mimic and copy techniques. What started as a purely instinctual behaviour, becomes something new through observation and mimicry. The meme is refined, the pathways evolve. 

And here's my question - are these behaviours passed down through genetics or memetics?  

The answer has to somehow be both. Memes of Non-Genetic Origin are memes that exist in a population, and an offspring has to learn those behaviours via mimicry and observation.

However - certain behaviours seem to be baked in to organisms. So the genes determine the lose structure of the neural pathways that give a predisposition for certain behaviours. Those neural pathways plus the genetic material and epigenetic factors are a physical manifestation of the meme that exists in the memome of the species. We shall call these - Crystallised Memes. These memes are so beneficial to the organism that they have somehow found a way to survive memetic extinction events via embedding themselves into the genome. These are memes that even if we took offspring from that species and had it live in isolation away from the group the same behaviours would be evolve. 

This leads me to the following questions: 
- How are the physical manifestations of Crystallised Memes created in brains? can beliefs acquired later in life be passed down genetically? How do brains evolve to have reflexes and built in behaviours that are not taught socially? How do we freeze behavioural knowledge into the genome over generations? Is it that those behaviours and instincts are so fundamental to the survival of the organism that the structure of the neural networks that encode them is somehow baked in the genetic and epigenetic material? Where is it encoded? Is there a difference between Crystallised Memes and [[fixed action patterns]]? What came first- the meme or the gene? Is it possible to encode a socially constructed behaviour in genes? #question 

Research Direction:
- Look into bears teaching cubs how to hunt salmon. Look into bird courtship songs and mating rituals. Look at tool use in the animal kingdom #look-into
