normality is a meme complex that we believe into existence. uniformity feels safe. smooth. but boring.

all my life I've had this low background radiation of boredom. it evolved my memome by damaging it. forgetfulness.

we have built many organisational cybernetic patterns to support the normal meme, and in the end there is a psycho-organisational feedback loop that supports the whole thing
