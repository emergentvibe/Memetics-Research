[[living with the moots]]

normality is a meme complex that we believe into existence. uniformity feels safe. smooth. but boring. all my life I've had this low background radiation of boredom. it evolved my memome by damaging it. forgetfulness.

we have built many organisational cybernetic patterns to support it, and in the end there is a psychoroginisational feedback loop that supports the whole thing
inside is like outside 
outside is like inside

our core desire in life is for those two to match
matched impedance so that current can flow
the current of consciousness
the current of creation
