enlightenment=process towards nirvana 

nirvana
- no reactivity
- realisation that thought constructs are empty of inherent reality - not identifying with memes
- non-dual awareness
- no self-centered motivation

the bodhisattva memetic complex
- the last clinging meme - a being chooses to keep this memeplex/self. this meme makes the host act in the society so that eventually all beings can reach nirvana
