*Creating cultural artefacts through meditative collective expression*

"Capturing an Emergent Vibe" brings together diverse participants in a structured yet spontaneous painting ritual designed to bypass critical thinking and access collective unconscious creativity. Through guided meditation, participants select colours reflecting their inner emotional weather and collaborate on large-scale canvases (2x2 meters). Working in three progressively detailed layers, the process begins with intuitive mark-making, evolves through pattern recognition, and culminates in collaborative refinementâ€”all without attachment to outcomes. Influenced by Jung, Pollock, and Twombly, this project creates a safe space for exploratory play while producing meaningful cultural artefacts. The resulting three canvases will travel to tpot community hubs in the US and Europe, serving as visual ambassadors that crystallise shared experiences across our global community. This grant will fund materials, facilitation, and transportation of these collaborative works, extending the transformative experience beyond the initial participants to wider audiences.
