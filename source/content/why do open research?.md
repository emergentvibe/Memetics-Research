why not? literally, this is just long form shit posting at this point, why not learn in public? I'm not afraid of making mistakes, or looking silly, or dumb, I'm on my own intellectual journey. I do this in public so I can 1) inspire others and 2) let others find me. And the more people find each other, we can start giving feedback to each other. It's incredible how often someone else has your missing piece, the exact right information that's been in your blindspots. Do stuff in the open!
