is open memetics research just open source surveillance for """""good""""?

open memetics research and anti-memes. 

memetics research has an obvious blindspot. antimemes. we can't study what is not being said in public. evil hides itself and camouflages itself. 

can we indirectly observe it? can we infer the existence of antimemes through observation of memes? can we "observe" the antimemes by looking at the ripples and shifts they cause in the public meme complex?

like astronomers discover exoplanets by observing the subtle wobble or periodic dimming of stars, or like black holes are studied by their accretion disk and gravitational lensing, or how Neptune was discovered through mathematical predictions based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, can we, through observing the cultural patterns on social media and mainstream broadcasting, infer or predict the type of antimemes that exist in a community?

what are the bad antimemes we are trying to indirectly observe?
