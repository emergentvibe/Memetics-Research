A meme is the basic unit of mental heredity. There are two kinds of memes. Behaviour Coding memes and non-coding memes. 
# Behaviour Coding Memes
I see memes I've picked up throughout my life affecting my behaviour at a deeply unconscious level all the time. I sneeze like my dad and I clear my throat like my mum. I sit like my grandfather. When I enter a room I usually greet people with a ðŸ¤™ which I picked up from a coworker. 
# Non-Coding Memes
One function of non-coding memes act as [[memetic regulators of meme expression]]. 

When is a behaviour applied? You have many memes, many behaviours. There must be an if-this-then-that kind of structure that also is of a memetic nature that can regulate the expression of memes.

![[memetic regulators of meme expression]]

these regulator is formed from the interaction of an emerging subculture/egregore/superorganism and is typically where neologisms form, leading to new language and memetic evolution.

then u can talk about phenotypic expression of memes and how the environment shapes the regulators, how they bundle up into part behaviours that build up your identity. i strongly believe there's predictive power here waiting to be discovered - will free will be destroyed? "if we are the slaves of some of "our" cultural traits, isn't it time we knew it?" (Cloak 1975)
