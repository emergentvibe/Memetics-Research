# the meme as the basic unit of mind
the meme is the behavioural analog of genes first introduced as a neologism by Richard Dawkins in his book "the selfish gene". like genes are the physical manifestations of genetic information, and through their expression into proteins we get cells, tissues, and organs, memes are the physical manifestations of the memetic information that through their expression we get instinct, habits, belief, identity, culture, social movements.

the meme is the basic unit of mental heredity that erases the boundaries between individual minds and allows us to model the mind as something that is shared through language.
