## the nested architecture of consciousness

the self exists as a nested hierarchy of memetic structures:

1. **memes** - individual idea units represented as vector embeddings in semantic space
2. **memeplexes** - clusters of mutually reinforcing memes that form coherent conceptual units
3. **parts** (IFS-style) - collections of memeplexes with specific activation functions and triggers, similar to how chromosomes package genes for coordinated expression
4. **orchestrated self** - the emergent pattern of parts interacting under the passive observation of the witness function

there's no "authentic self" hiding beneath these layers - just the characteristic pattern of how these components interact in your particular brain. the "you" that you experience is simply the collection and orchestration of parts operating at any given moment.

when parts step back and unblend, something remains - a witnessing presence with qualities of curiosity, compassion, and clarity. this "Self energy" (in IFS terms) emerges when the system is functioning optimally. what I call the orchestrator is a special function that helps parts step back and resolves tensions between them, working alongside this witnessing presence. many people function with blended parts without experiencing much Self energy, yet still operate effectively in the world.

parts don't just exist as abstract patterns - they often resonate with specific body locations in a kind of weird synesthesia. certain memeplexes activate specific body sensations - tightness in the throat, warmth in the chest, tension in the gut. this embodied aspect connects to emerging research on vasocomputation, the idea that blood flow patterns and physiological processes contribute to cognition outside the brain.

what's wilder still is that parts aren't confined to individual minds. they exist between all of us - we absorb them from others, especially our parents, and from what jung called the "collective unconscious" - or what i prefer to call the memetic ecosystem. this shared environment contains part templates that we download and customize through our experiences.

## memory externalisation
the invention of writing was a major milestone in the evolution of complex memetic organisms. 

## why we need better models

our current understanding of how ideas move through individuals and groups remains remarkably limited. we lack frameworks that can predict:

- why certain ideas spread rapidly while others fade
- how belief systems interact and evolve
- why groups develop specific patterns of thought
- how individual psychology connects to collective dynamics

these aren't just academic questions. in an age of unprecedented memetic warfare and manipulation, understanding how ideas shape us - both individually and collectively - has become essential to maintaining agency and social coherence.

## mathematical formulation

to address these limitations, we can model the memetic structures mathematically - not as a complete representation of consciousness, but as a useful approximation of its dynamics:

1. **Individual Meme Activation** $A(m_i) = \text{activation}(\sum_j (w_{ij} \times A(m_j)) - \theta_i, \alpha_i)$

Where activation function balances categorical vs. contextual processing: $\text{activation}(x, \alpha) = (1-\alpha) \times \text{leftMode}(x) + \alpha \times \text{rightMode}(x)$

2. **Memeplex Formation from Memes** $M_i = {(\vec{v}_1, p_1), (\vec{v}_2, p_2), \ldots, (\vec{v}_n, p_n)}$

Where $\vec{v}_j$ is a meme vector and $p_j$ is its probability/weight within the memeplex.

3. **Memeplex-to-Memeplex Influence** $R(M_i) = \text{activation}(\sum_j (w_{ij} \times A(M_j)) + b_i, \alpha_{M_i})$

4. **Competitive Activation Between Memeplexes** $A(M_i) = \text{softmax}(R(M_1), R(M_2), \ldots, R(M_n))_i = \frac{e^{R(M_i)}}{\sum_j e^{R(M_j)}}$


This system of equations creates a dynamic model where memes cluster into memeplexes, which then interact through both excitatory and inhibitory connections, competing for expression in consciousness.

Therapeutic interventions can be understood as tuning the variables in this system - adjusting connection weights ($w_{ij}$), modifying activation thresholds ($\theta_i$), or shifting processing styles ($\alpha_i$). Effective therapy might involve weakening inhibitory connections from protector parts to exiled parts, or enhancing the activation of adaptive memeplexes.

Meanwhile, the environment defines the semantic contents - the specific meme vectors that populate the system. Our experiences, culture, and relationships determine what memes are available and how they're encoded in our cognitive landscape.

This is merely an exploratory model, not a claim about how human consciousness actually works. It's a left-brain approach to understanding phenomena that are ultimately more complex than any mathematical framework can fully capture. The value lies not in perfect accuracy but in creating a useful tool for thinking about these invisible dynamics.

## implementation through journaling

how might we test and refine this theoretical model? one approach would be through analyzing unfiltered streams of consciousness.

imagine a journaling app where you can't press backspace - eliminating the inner critic from the writing process. by preventing editing and revision, it captures raw stream of consciousness material direct from the memetic source.

this theoretical app would extract embeddings and semantic ideas from your writing and those of your friend group, processing private streams collectively while maintaining individual privacy. it could identify tensions in the shared semantic space and generate questions for the collective to answer - essentially functioning as cognitive therapy for friend groups.

## filling in the variables

how do we estimate the variables in our model from stream of consciousness data? the unfiltered nature of these journals provides a window into memetic processes as they unfold. natural language processing can extract key concepts as meme vectors, with clustering algorithms identifying memeplexes based on co-occurrence patterns. shifting language patterns, tone, and thematic focus help identify distinct parts, while analyzing the triggers that precede these shifts illuminates activation functions. even physical sensations can be mapped as embodied expressions of specific memetic patterns. as longitudinal data accumulates, machine learning algorithms refine these models, revealing patterns that might not be consciously apparent even to the person themselves.

## from individual to collective modeling

now scale this up. by modeling all the orchestrated selves in a group, we can see how memes spread among members, and how parts co-regulate and sync after a group collocates and uses AI-powered journaling tools to highlight and resolve tensions.

this journaling approach is designed for exactly this collective dimension. by maintaining private journals but processing them collectively, it creates a map of the group's shared semantic space. the tensions it identifies and the questions it generates serve as interventions that help the collective achieve greater memetic integration.

through this process, the group becomes something more than just a collection of individuals - they form an "egregore," a bundle of coordinated selves with shared language evolution and synchronized memetic patterns. just as groups of isolated deaf children spontaneously develop their own sign languages with consistent grammar and syntax (like the famous case of Nicaraguan Sign Language), groups of people who think together develop shared conceptual vocabularies and reasoning patterns that become increasingly efficient for their particular environment.

this collective modeling allows us to:

- identify shared memeplexes that bind the group together
- spot potential memetic conflicts before they manifest
- predict how new ideas will propagate through the social network
- understand how group dynamics emerge from individual memetic patterns

we're essentially building both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for collective consciousness.

## predictive applications

once we have this model, we can run simulations: "what happens if we introduce this new meme to the group?" we could model how it propagates, which existing memeplexes it reinforces or conflicts with, and how the group's memetic equilibrium shifts in response.

specifically, we could predict:

- which ideas will gain traction vs. facing resistance
- how introducing a new person changes group dynamics
- where ideological fault lines might emerge
- what interventions could help maintain cognitive diversity

potential applications extend far beyond friend groups:

- organizational team dynamics and optimizing team composition
- predicting and addressing political polarization
- designing more effective educational curriculum
- developing more precise therapeutic approaches for trauma and mental health
- creating AI therapy systems that better understand the complex interplay of beliefs

for AI applications, the mathematical framework could help systems identify and target intervention points in unhealthy thought patterns. for group dynamics, it offers a way to model how ideas spread and potentially predict conflicts before they become problematic.

i'm trying to build a prototype of this system and would welcome collaboration. the technical challenges are significant but surmountable, and the potential insights into both individual psychology and collective dynamics make it worth pursuing.

clearly, this theoretical framework will require rigorous empirical validation. the journaling system described could provide data for testing specific hypotheses and potentially falsifying aspects of the model. developing experiments to verify or challenge the predictions made by this framework would be an essential next step in its development.

## the bigger picture

this approach reframes so much of human experience:

- mental health as memetic ecosystem health
- relationships as memetic ecosystem interactions
- creativity as novel memetic combinations
- learning as memetic integration and restructuring

when we zoom out further, we begin to see egregore interactions - group-to-group meme exchanges that shape cultural evolution. different cultural egregores interact through globalization, exchanging memes and sometimes developing resistance mechanisms to foreign memeplexes. racism can be understood as a form of eumemics - the policing of behavior and expression to maintain the purity of a cultural memeplex, rejecting "foreign" patterns as threats to memetic integrity.

these dynamics play out in everything from immigration policies to language preservation efforts to cultural appropriation debates. the tension between memetic diversity (which creates innovation) and memetic coherence (which creates identity) lies at the heart of many social conflicts.

it's not that we're "controlled" by memes - we ARE memes, or rather, we are the unique patterns of relationship between memes that emerge in our particular cognitive substrate.

the memetic soul model doesn't reduce human experience; it reveals its stunning complexity and the beautiful emergence of what we call self from the dance of ideas across the neural landscape.

the map is never the territory, but better maps lead to new discoveries. this model is merely an approximation, but perhaps with better models of our memetic nature, we might navigate both our inner landscapes and our collective challenges with greater wisdom. this framework doesn't offer liberation on its own - that requires the spiritual work of individuals - but it might provide tools that assist skilled facilitators in healing collective systems through more intelligent guidance and intervention.

just as quantum mechanics uses mathematics to describe phenomena we can't directly observe, this framework attempts to model the invisible architecture of idea transmission and influence. the value isn't in perfect accuracy but in creating new ways to think about and work with these complex dynamics that shape our individual and collective experience.

we began by noting that we're walking memeplexes in skin suits. perhaps by understanding the patterns of these memeplexes more clearly - both within and between us - we might walk with greater awareness, purpose, and collective harmony.
