Regulators can upregulate or downregulate the expression of a meme.

A combination of a regulator and a behaviour coding meme is what is often called an "Antimeme" - a behaviour that wont spread, it is self-contained.

An anti meme is the combination of two memes - a regular meme that codes for behaviour and a regulator that "contains"  the expression of that behaviour. 
e.g. secrecy/illegibility, shame, social taboos
