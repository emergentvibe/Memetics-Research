**Hi! I'm [Emergent](https://x.com/emergentvibe). Welcome to my research vault!**

I'm setting up this digital garden as an attempt to satisfy my own curiosity. I am just learning in public.

1. I want to understand how memes shape our identity, our language, and our consciousness. 
2. I build [[software]] that can help us understand how social media shapes our individual and collective identity. 
3. I host [[workshops|collective painting workshops]] to capture the emergent creative expression of a collective.

For more information regarding my long term motivations checkout my [[research manifesto]] and [[research strategy]].
