do u guys know about building 20?

  

building 20 was a radiation lab turned magical science incubator in MIT. it had a weird layout and it was a temporary wooden structure which allowed for heavy modifications to the structure of the building by the scientists

it before WWII ended, it housed the MIT radiation lab where fundamental advances were made in electromagnetics.

more than 20$ of the physicists in the USA had worked in that building (including 9 Nobel prize winners)

after the war ended

building 20 will soon re-emerge - this time it will be full of ai safety engineers, memetic organisational psycho-cyberneticists, and quantum computing engineers

building 20 was a radiation lab during WWII that was turned into a magical science incubator in MIT 
it had a weird layout and it was a temporary wooden structure which allowed for heavy modifications to the structure of the building by the scientists
more than 20% of the physicists in the USA had worked in that building (including 9 nobel prize winners)

i believe building 20 will soon re-emerge. we don't know where, but there's a need for it in the world to exist.
it's the first time where a major technological breakthrough is on the hands of the private sector
imagine if before WWII the discovery of the atomic bomb was in private corporation hands
along with los alamos, the rad lab at building 20 was one of the "two prominent shrines of the triumph of science during the war"
where is this shrine today?
