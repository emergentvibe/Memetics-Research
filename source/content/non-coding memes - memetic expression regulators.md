one function of non-coding memes is regulation of other memes.

When is a behaviour applied? You have many memes, many behaviours. There must be an if-this-then-that kind of structure that also is of a memetic nature that can regulate the expression of memes.

Regulators can upregulate or downregulate the expression of a meme. see [[memetic regulator classifications]] for more details.
