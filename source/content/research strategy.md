I follow the principles of Agile, so this research is very incremental and iterative. See [[get to done]].

My aim is to perform a systematic review the literature and pin down definitions and develop a shared language we can all use to develop this scientific field.

I do this in [[foundational memetics]] and [[foundational cybernetics]]

Next, I aim to explore the impact of LLMs to the complex system of [[life|life]], since they are a kind of memetic processor. I aim to do this in [[somewhat watered essay seeds]].
