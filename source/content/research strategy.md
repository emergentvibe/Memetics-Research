[[self critique]]

I follow the principles of Agile, so this research is very incremental and iterative. See [[get to done]].

I aim to explore the impact of LLMs and modern communication networks to the complex system of [[life|life]], since they are a kind of memetic processor. My aim is to perform a systematic review the literature and work that is being done at the forefront of memetics, pin down definitions and develop a shared language we can all use to develop this scientific field. I aim to do this in [[foundational memetics]] and [[foundational cybernetics]] (mostly placeholder pages atm). As I go through the literature, I develop my takes, the things I care about, and musings about potential things to study/build in my [[essays]].
