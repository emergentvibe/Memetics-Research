I follow the principles of Agile, so this research is very incremental and iterative. See [[get to done]].

I aim to explore the impact of LLMs and modern communication networks to our individual and collective identity.

My plan is to perform a systematic review the literature and work that is being done at the forefront of memetics, pin down definitions and develop a shared language we can all use to develop this scientific field. I aim to do this in [[foundations]].

As I go through the literature I write [[somewhat watered essay seeds|essays]] to make sense of if all and to explain it in simpler language for a wider audience.
