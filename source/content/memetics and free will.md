where is the locus of free will??? different answers result to different ideologies. free will is a class of behaviour that is only defined by contrasting it to its surroundings.

pattern i've noticed is the happier i am the less i think about free will, because i only think about free will when i am not equanimous - at least in the past.

i worry a lot about surrendering my agency to others, but in a way i realise, there's no-one else to surrender it to. god perhaps - sure. but god to me IS others. Lacan called it "the big other", Jung called it the collective unconscious - i call it - the superorganism. memecomplex, egregore. whatevs.
