# mapping the memetic soul: toward a predictive model of human consciousness

our current models of consciousness remain fragmented and incomplete - psychology describes behaviours, neuroscience maps brain activity, philosophy debates the nature of self. but what if we could develop a unified framework that bridges individual experience with collective dynamics? what if consciousness itself could be understood as an emergent property of memetic interactions?

![[memes - coding and regulating behaviour]]

 ![[the source of behaviour]]
then u can talk about phenotypic expression of memes and how the environment shapes the regulators, how they bundle up into part behaviours that build up your identity. i strongly believe there's predictive power here waiting to be discovered - will free will be destroyed? "if we are the slaves of some of "our" cultural traits, isn't it time we knew it?" (Cloak 1975)
