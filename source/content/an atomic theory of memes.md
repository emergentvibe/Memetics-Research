memes are things? do they exist in physical reality? hmmmmm kinda!

you can't see a gene with the naked eye - you'll argue it's still a physical thing made out of atoms or whatever. and memes... memes are just... etherial.

but are they?!! or do we not have the tools to see them yet?

will the discovery of a [[nooscope]] - a microscope for the world 3, the world of ideas (Karl Popper) - allow us to see the shape of these memes and develop an atomic and molecular theory? 

can i write an equation like a chemical reaction but for memes and predict what the memetic products and byproducts will be?
