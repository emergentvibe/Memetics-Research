[[eumemics]]

Euformatics: The control of the information patterns that define [[life|life]] (genes, and memes) is the theory that forms can be improved through selective breeding of their populations. Euformatics is the generalised term for Eugenics and Eumemics.

I am struggling to separate the concept of Euformatics from the concept of "Information Natural Selection" - because in the end â€“ what the hell is """natural""" and why is it """good"""?

What is the source of Euformatic Regulation? Is it [[memetic regulators and meme expression|memetic regulators]]? Is there an equivelant for genetic information (perhaps viruses that target specific genes)? CRISPR like engineered/evolved super-viruses. I doubt anything like that would naturally evolve from pure genetics but weirder things have happened ig. I think the most likely source of Euformatic Regulation (Regulation of Genes and Memes of a [[life|life form]]) is [[memes of non-genetic origin]].

I'd like to say that Euformatics is not the same as natural selection of information - euformatics points to the enforced control of information by an authority, often through violence - just like eugenics. 

Perhaps what we should be focusing on is progenics and [[promemetics|promemetics]] - ways to let the human genome and memome evolve and flourish without intervention by engineered/evolved memetic regulator viruses (beliefs about what phenotypes are """good""", and what behaviours are """good""").

All information and its expression is good. Even if the expression of that information brings death to a wider ecosystem - like the expression of cancerous DNA in human bodies, or the expression of radicalising memes in internet echo-chambers leading to terrorist attacks. 

"How can death ever be good?" you may ask. I personally value life more than anything, but death is often a symbol, a highlight of imbalance in a system. I believe that these radical memes and genes would not evolve or even be expressed were it not for the constant oppression, suffering, and scarcity that the individuals and egregores experience.

Freedom of speech is a kind of [[promemetics|promemetic]] memetic regulator, but leads to the danger of [[eumemics|eumemic]] or even antimemetic memetic regulators evolving. The mitigation to this danger is not restriction of information - its abundance of energy.
