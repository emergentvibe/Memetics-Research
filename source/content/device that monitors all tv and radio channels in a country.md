we can literally build an open source lil tv receiver that receives all TV and radio signals in an area, transcribes audio, labels/classifies footage
then we have SOOOOOO0 much data from mainstream discourse!

like - boomers are not online, they are just spoon fed propaganda

and often online discourse is soooo much different from the stuff on TV
