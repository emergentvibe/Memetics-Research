**Hi! I'm [Emergent](https://x.com/emergentvibe). Welcome to my research vault!**

I'm setting up this curated open source digital garden as an attempt to satisfy my own curiosity regarding the complex fractal eco-system that we call *[[life|life]]*. I am attempting to unify the fields of sociobiology, psychology, and sociology by contributing to the refinement of two new linguistic frames/scientific fields: [[memetics]] and [[cybernetics]].

I don't just want to write essays. I want to build/design/inspire the creation of apps that:
- [[project proposals to solve coordination problems|improve the coordination of research teams]]
- [[project proposals for an open ecosystem of apps for memetics research|contribute to the invention of a nooscope]]

For more information regarding my long term motivations (besides innate curiosity) checkout my [[research manifesto]] and [[research strategy]], and to find out where I'm taking my research next checkout my [[research direction]], [[map of content]], and [[map of future content]].

Do you like what I'm trying to do? 
- why don't you [[fund me]]?
- why don't you [[contribute]]?

More [[about me]].

This research is done in partnership with the [Open Research Institute](https://open-research-institute.github.io/)
