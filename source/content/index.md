**Hi! I'm [Emergent](https://x.com/emergentvibe). Welcome to my research vault!**

I'm setting up this digital garden as an attempt to satisfy my own curiosity. I do not claim to be an authority on any of this - I am just learning in public.

I want to understand how memes shapes our identity, our language, and our consciousness. As I gain greater understanding of memetics, I want to build [[apps]] that can help us understand how social media shapes our individual and collective identity. For more information regarding my long term motivations checkout my [[research manifesto]] and [[research strategy]].

This research is done in partnership with the [Open Research Institute](https://open-research-institute.github.io/)
