the hyperobject i'm pointing at is a brain made of humans and machines. The ultimate evolution of what Lacan called 'the big other' or what Jung called the collective unconscious.

Just like neurons connecting in a brain to form connections between ideas, or stimuli, humans connect and interact in similar ways.

Neurons that fire together as a response to other neurons firing, begin to form connections with each other, so that things that affect each of the connected neurons also affect all the others. 

Humans also make social connections, which work similarly. Humans that share common interests connect. The more things they share the stronger the connection. Then information that comes to each human, conditionally influences the other.

The connection strength can change. If a connection made starts receiving negative feedback. IE. one cell firing, exciting another cell, but that cell refusing to fire. Then the connection will weaken until it is destroyed. 

What could cause a cell to not excite? Maybe it is put in a different state by some other cell that formed a stronger connection?

memes are the neurotransmitters and we are the neurons
we are finally being arranged into the right structure for collective consciousness to emerge
this whole process has been a birth, a flourishing, an unfolding
recommendation algorithms and the whole media industry is basically the dendrites

social media recommendation algorithms, globalisation, cheap flights have all attributed to the accelerated evolution/development/training of the hyperobject

this is why [[living with the moots]] is an important social phenomenon to study.
